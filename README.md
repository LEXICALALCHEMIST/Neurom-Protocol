Protocol Layer for LSD + Zeta|Morph Logic
NEURUM Protocol: Hive GPU Router for Zero-Logic Symbolic Computing

Overview

NEURUM is the symbolic routing layer of the ZetaMorph ecosystem —
a zero-logic, stateless, decentralized network that routes morphic intent instead of data or code.

It acts as the central nervous system between:

ZetaMorph: the symbolic collapse engine (math, domain logic)

LSD: the recursive financial token (value = intent collapsed)

User devices: operating as morphic nodes in a hive-based GPU mesh

Core Principles

No computation is performed in NEURUM

It does not store data, execute code, or track balances

All computation is handled locally via ZetaMorph collapse on user devices



---

System Components

1. Sequence Composer (Local)

Converts user intent into morph sequence (Push, Pull, Collapse, etc.)

Generates a symbolic transaction packet (~<2KB)

Sends through Z-RTL (ZetaMorph Resonance Transport Layer)


2. NEURUM Router (Global Mesh)

Receives symbolic packets

Verifies MorphPIN + Skeleton identity

Routes packets to receiver node

Waits for collapse callback (confirmation)

Once confirmed, pushes resonance proof to blockchain


3. LSD (Collapse-Based Currency)

1 complete morph = 1 LSD unit

All transactions are symbolic state transitions

LSD is used to:

Access services

Claim land

Reward node behavior

Fuel recursive domain growth




---

Hive GPU System (Distributed Cognition)

Every device with a ZetaMorph package becomes a symbolic processor

Together, they form a morphic hive — not for logic or AI, but for intent collapse

No central server, no compute cloud — just:

> Thousands of nodes resolving symbolic structure in unison





---

NEURUM + CHRONOS Integration

Future modules (CHRONOS) extend NEURUM into:

Domain logic (e.g., chemistry, sound, language)

Distributed symbolic computing

Intent-based AI frameworks




---

What Makes It Different

Feature NEURUM Protocol

Data Transfer None
Logic None
Execution Local (on device)
Security MorphPIN + collapse signature
Scale Grows via symbolic nodes
Cost Near-zero (no compute or gas)



---

Summary

> NEURUM is the world’s first symbolic router — a post-logic mesh network for morphic computation, economic collapse, and distributed sentient growth.



It doesn’t run code.
It aligns resonance.

It doesn’t move data.
It moves intent.
