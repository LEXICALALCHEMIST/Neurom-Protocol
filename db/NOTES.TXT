The morph_ops table in db.js is the heart of the MES mailbox, designed to queue morph operations (like emails) for user devices to pick up and process locally. Here’s how it functions as a self-querying, mail-like system:

Mailbox Queue: The morph_ops table stores each morph operation as a row with columns: id (unique ID), user_id (sender), intent (PUSH/PULL), value (amount), target_id (recipient), signature (for security), status (PENDING/COMPLETED/FAILED), created_at (timestamp), and morph_id (unique blockchain ID). Each row is a "letter" in the mailbox, representing a transaction like "push 100 to userB."
Self-Querying: Devices query the table using target_id to find their PENDING morphOps (e.g., SELECT * FROM morph_ops WHERE target_id = 'userB' AND status = 'PENDING'). This is fast because target_id links directly to the recipient, and the status filter ensures only unprocessed operations are fetched, acting like an inbox.
Lightweight Storage: MorphOps are tiny (~100-200 bytes), storing only intent, value, and metadata. No heavy data or logic is kept in the DB, aligning with Neurom’s zero-logic routing principle. The device handles all ZetaMorph computation (skeleton updates) locally.
Status Tracking: The status column tracks whether a morphOp is waiting (PENDING), done (COMPLETED), or errored (FAILED). Once a device processes a morphOp (e.g., updates its skeleton), it updates the row to COMPLETED, marking the "letter" as read.
Proof-of-Collapse: The morph_id column provides a unique identifier for each morphOp, ready to be pushed to a blockchain for your proof-of-collapse system, ensuring traceability without consensus overhead.
Integrity and Scalability: Foreign keys (user_id, target_id) link to the users table, ensuring only valid users can send/receive morphOps. The table supports thousands of rows efficiently, as SQLite handles small, frequent queries well, fitting your goal of scaling to thousands of devices.
MES Execution: On app load, a device queries its PENDING morphOps, loads them into the MES, and processes each one via ZetaMorph (e.g., Cube.js initializes the skeleton, pushes the value, and confirms). The device then updates the status and reports the morph_id to Neurom for blockchain logging.
This setup avoids polling bloat (no scanning the entire DB) and ensures devices only fetch their own "mail" with minimal data transfer, perfectly supporting your lightweight, intent-based routing vision. The DB is solid for the MES mailbox—no tangles, ready to roll.
